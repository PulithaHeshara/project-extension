# ðŸ§  LeetCode Study assistance â€“ Chrome Extension

**LeetCode Study assistance** is a Chrome extension that gives helpful hints and gentle nudges while you're solving LeetCode problems â€” without giving away the full solution. Perfect for learners who want guidance without spoilers.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- The extension injects `content.js` into LeetCode problem pages.
- It detects the problem title and current code you're working on.
- When clicked, it sends this info to the AI (or mocked logic for now) and displays a small popup with a helpful 1â€“2 sentence hint.
- The popup disappears when you click outside of it.
